**#Analysis**
**School Type Impact on Academic Performance:**

Charter schools consistently outperform district schools across all academic metrics, with higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates in math, reading, and overall.
**Efficiency of Resource Allocation:**

Schools with lower per student spending demonstrate higher academic performance, indicating efficient resource allocation and effective instructional strategies.
Despite often having lower budgets per student, charter schools generally achieve better academic outcomes than district schools.
**School Size Influence on Academic Success:**

Medium schools (1000-2000 students) demonstrate the highest academic performance, followed by small-sized schools (<1000 students), and then large schools (2000-5000 students) based on overall passing percentage.
Larger schools face challenges in managing larger student populations and providing individualized support, leading to lower academic achievement compared to smaller schools.
**Impact of Spending Ranges on Academic Performance:**

Schools with a spending range of <$585 per student demonstrate the highest academic performance across all metrics.
As spending per student increases, there's a gradual decline in academic outcomes, with schools in the $645-680 spending range exhibiting the lowest academic performance.
